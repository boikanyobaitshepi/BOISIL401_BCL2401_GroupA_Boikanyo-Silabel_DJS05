This project demonstrates a simple implementation of a tally counter using a custom state management store in JavaScript. The store manages the state of the application using a reducer and allows for subscribing to state changes.

Custom State Management Store: Implemented from scratch, similar to Redux.
Tally Counter Reducer: Pure function to manage counter state.
Actions: Add, Subtract, and Reset the counter.
Subscription Mechanism: Notify listeners of state changes.
store.js: Contains the Store class, the tally counter reducer, and test scenarios.
